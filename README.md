The project aim is to develop both Densely Connected Network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network capable of predicting the football league table, at the end of the season, of the top 10 European Leagues. To do so, we used data about teamâ€™s match statistics in respect to the league where they compete, from season 2014/15 until 2018/19 for the first model, and season 2017/18 and 2018/19 for the second one, in order to predict the current unfinished season, that is, season 2019/20 before the coronavirus outbreak stoppage. Said that, we are under a regression problem, in which we propose to predict average number of points per game and, therefore, knowing the total number of league matches throughout the season we are then able to predict the league table ranking.
