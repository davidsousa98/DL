The project aim is to develop both Densely Connected Network model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network capable of predicting the league table, at the end of the season, of the top 10 European Leagues. To do so, we used data about team’s match statistics in respect to the league where they compete, from season 2014/15 until 2018/19 in order to predict the current unfinished season, that is, season 2019/20 before the coronavirus outbreak stoppage. Said that, we are under a regression problem, in which we propose to predict average number of points per game and, therefore, knowing the total number of league matches throughout the season we are then able to predict the league table ranking.
